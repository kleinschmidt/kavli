# Planning

## Who is the audience

People have to attend two weeks.  First week brain+lang+prediction, second week
RL.  Mix of background, some more computational, some cog neuro.  Gina says
**more teaching than cutting edge research**, and to focus on domain general
prediction/adaptation and not _exclusively_ on language.

## What is the topic

Title is "Computational perspectives on language prediction in the brain".  My
lecture is the second one.  About linking prediction and adaptation (and the
brain???)

## What is the goal

* Prediction and adaptation are two sides of the same coin.
* Prediction requires **probabilistic knowledge**.
* Adaptation requires prediction at **multiple levels**.
* It's an open question how to link probabilistic predictions/processing to
  brain organization and processing.

# Framing 

Could frame things around linking statistics of the world with
processing/representation (motivation connection with brain).  Start with
e.g. sparse coding, and work up to multiple (shorter) time scales.

Another motivation is that this is a topic that naturally cuts across all three
of Marr's levels, and there's a lot of low hanging fruit, interesting work that
bridges these levels.
